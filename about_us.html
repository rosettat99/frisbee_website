                        <h1> Our Team</h1>
                        <p> Established in 2019, Botany Downs Secondary College's ultimate frisbee team is named Botany Hammer after our team's speciality frisbee throw. The team was initially made up of a few Senior male students, however has grown into a mixed team ranging across age and experience. Our team is mixed across all genders and year levels and provides a fun opportunity for students to get involved and be active in a relaxed, social sport. Our team currently consists of around 20 students, from years 10-13, however we are always looking forward for new students to join our team. Our team prides ourselves on our team spirit values, as we strive to always encourage one another We also strongly value our team traditions as we get ice cream after every tournament to bond with the team. </p>

                        <h1> Trainings</h1>
                        <p> Our Ultimate Frisbee team has weeky trainings on Saturday mornings from 11AM to 1PM. Depending on what part of the season we are in, we will either train outdoors on the field or Astroturf or otherwise if it is indoor season we will play in the gym. During trainings, we get to learn a variety of frisbee handling techniques, whilst also undergoing other drills such as duking, and marking in order to improve our frisbee performance. During trainings, we also have games that are either 4 or 5 a side.</p>

                        <p> Our Ultimate Frisbee team is currently led by two University students who graduated Botany Downs Secondary College last year. Whilst at College, they played in the Ultimate Frisbee team for many years. Our team is currently being guest coached by a member of the Auckland University Ultimate Club, and was formerly a student of Pakuranga College. Our coaches put in lots of time and effort into developing our team and have made significant contributions to our teams performance.</p>
