This was the first tournament for many of our new players and they all adapted very well to playing against our opponents. Luckily, there was optimal weather conditions, as the wind and sun were not too strong so our team was able to play to our best abilities. Despite, not placing our team tried their very best and had loads of fun during the tournament and had many beneficial learning experiences along the way. </p>
